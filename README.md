collecting data like solar panal images and lables using Roboflow some classes like birth drop, physical damage, electric damage,dust,snow, these type of class lables according to them preprocessing, Augmentation you can done with using Roboflow and traning using Yolov8n in the working code
open Google colab connect GPU
5195_solar_panel_yolov8t_object _detection_on_custom_dataset.ipynb
after traning used as many epoch as per mAP ,mAP50 until stop Increasing 
important to save best.pt file in your computer 
app.py file is for streamlit deployment code  
in that colab used deploy_cod3.ipynb for streamlit deployment 
all the deployment libraries in the run streamlit on google colab.txt file
